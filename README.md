# 🚀 LinkedIn Profile Scraper 🖥️


📊 Extract LinkedIn profile data from an Excel file containing candidate URLs! This script scrapes essential profile information, including the candidate's name, profession, connections, about me section, and education.


# 🔍 Features

- 🧑‍💼 Name - Scrape the full name of the candidate.

- 💼 Profession - Extract their current job title.

- 🔗 Connections - Retrieve the number of LinkedIn connections.

- ✍️ About Me - Fetch the "About Me" section from the profile.

# 📂 Input & Output

- Input: An Excel file (.xlsx) containing a list of LinkedIn profile URLs.

- Output: The output format is entirely up to you! 🎨 My recommendation is to export the scraped data into either:

    * 📊 An updated Excel file with all the profiles.
